## About

[PyRoss](https://gitlab.com/rajeshrinet/pyross) is a numerical library for mathematical modelling of infectious disease in Python. The library supports **structured compartment models** formulated **stochastically** (as chemical master equations) or **deterministically** (as systems of differential equations). A **hybrid algorithm** transits smoothly between these limits depending on the magnitude of the compartmental fluctions.

The library uses **Gaussian process regression**, on both the epidemiological manifold and its tangent space, to estimate model parameters given epidemiological data. These estimates are convolved with the instrinsic stochasticty of the dynamics to provide **Bayesian forecasts** of the progress of the epidemic.

Non-pharmaceutical interventions are implemented as controls on the **contact structures** of the model. **Optimal control** of these structures, given **cost functions**, is currently under development.

The library is designed to be model-agnostic. Currently implemented [models](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross/blob/master/docs/models.pdf) are  **SIR**, **SIRS**, **SEIR**, **SEI5R**, **SIkR**, **SEkIkR**, **SEAIR**, and **SEAIRQ**.

The genesis of PyRoss was to model the outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 and to assess the age-structured impact of social distancing measures in India. It can be used to study such impact for **any demographic** for which the age and
contact structures are available.

The library is named after [Sir Ronald Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Ross), doctor, mathematician and poet. In 1898 he made "the great discovery" in his laboratory in Calcutta "that malaria is conveyed by the bite of a mosquito".  He won the Nobel Prize in 1902 and laid the foundations of the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases.

This paper is amongst the  **top ten most read COVID-19 papers** on [Research Gate
](https://www.researchgate.net/community/COVID-19). The authors have received (literally) hundreds of emails with inquiries and apologise that they can no longer respond individually to these. Please read the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross/wiki/FAQ-on-COVID-19-India-paper) in the first instance. The authors promise to include questions not covered in the FAQ as soon as possible.

The figures below show how the lockdown forecasts from the paper are altered by a change in the epidemiological model. The SIR model provides a lower bound on the rapidity with which the epidemic decreases. All other models exceed this bound, as shown for an SEIR model. Both models are fitted to the
number of infectives using case data for India till 25-03-2020.

## Examples

PyRoss has a formulation-agnostic and  intuitive interface. Once a model is instantiated, stochastic, deterministic and hybrid simulations can performed through the same interface. The example below shows how to set up a deterministic SIR simulation. See the [examples folder](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross/tree/master/examples) for more Jupyter notebook examples.

```Python
# Ex1: M=1, SIR
import numpy as np
import pyross


M     = 1                  # the SIR model has no age structure
Ni    = 1000*np.ones(M)    # so there is only one age group
N     = np.sum(Ni)         # and the total population is the size of this age group

beta  = 0.2                # infection rate
gIa   = 0.1                # recovery rate of asymptomatic infectives
gIs   = 0.1                # recovery rate of symptomatic infectives
alpha = 0                  # fraction of asymptomatic infectives
fsa   = 1                  # the self-isolation parameter

Ia0   = np.array([0])      # the SIR model has only one kind of infective
Is0   = np.array([1])      # we take these to be symptomatic
R0    = np.array([0])      # and assume there are no recovered individuals initially
S0    = N-(Ia0+Is0+R0)     # initial susceptibles are obtained from S + Ia + Is + R = N


# there is no contact structure
def contactMatrix(t):   
    return np.identity(M)


# instantiate model
parameters = {'alpha':alpha, 'beta':beta, 'gIa':gIa, 'gIs':gIs, 'fsa':fsa}
model      = pyross.deterministic.SIR(parameters, M, Ni)


# simulate model
Tf, Nt = 160,  160           # duration of simulation and data points
data = model.simulate(S0, Ia0, Is0, contactMatrix, Tf, Nt)
```
